## FEX.NET

This extension uses the `cloudFile` (a.k.a. FileLink) API that first appeared in Thunderbird 64. [Documentation](https://thunderbird-webextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cloudFile.html).

Please note that the CloudFile user interface is undergoing some changes, but everything should continue to work.
